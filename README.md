# Flatool
A python-coded general-purpose tool bot.

## üöÄ Roadmap for v1.0.0

This roadmap outlines potential ideas and future improvements. Features listed here are not guaranteed and may change over time.  

### ‚úÖ Completed  
- [x] Initial bot setup  
- [x] /say and /ping commands  

### üîÑ In Progress  
- [ ] Auto/manual reacting based on outside bot message  

  <details>
    <summary>What would this do?</summary>
    This would be for replying to bots like Appy or any other bot. It would add reactions based on what a bot says (customizable trigger words) or manually with a command.  

    The reactions would be also customizable, this would be useful for having mini "old school polls" on bot messages.  

    Use cases would likely be varied but for one of the aforementioned Appy, which is a mod application bot, it would allow you to auto-start polls on applications, which Appy doesn't do by default.

### üìù Plans / Ideas  
- [x] Having a bot people could use without self-hosting  

  <details>
    <summary>Why?</summary>
    Not everyone is the best at doing things with Discord bots. Despite the purpose of just small tools, a central Discord bot could be nice.  

    Again, as the section says, this is just an idea.
    
    Update 3/25/25
    I now have the ability to host the bot on a server that is reliable, i also have the bot made, its just not able to be used by the general public until version 1.0 has released. Hurray!
  </details>  

- [ ] Having a dashboard one could hook up to their domain  

  <details>
    <summary>What would this do?</summary>
    This would just be for easier setup of permissions.  

    If I end up making a central bot, then I will make a public access one, but for self-hosting, I would like to somehow have an injectable dashboard for someone's domain.  

    I don't know exactly what I'm talking about, but you get the gist.  

    Some other cool ideas for this: If this does happen, I would like to have some type of terminal in the dash that lets you send bot commands that will affect things in the server.  

    This would be like your "console." Any actions done in said console would have a logging area in the dash and in the server.

- [ ] Basic moderation/Case logging  

_Features and priorities may shift based on feedback and needs._
